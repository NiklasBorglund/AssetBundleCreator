---------------------------------------
This editor extension is created to make it really easy for everyone to create asset bundles.

This extension lets you specify a folder in your unity project, which this extension will then take
and create an assetbundle for each and every subfolder in that folder.

By default, that folder is : "/BundleCreator/Data/AssetBundles/"
and the asset bundles will by default be created in: Application.dataPath + "/../AssetBundles/"

If you create a subfolder called assetbundle01, the asset bundle will be named assetbundle01.unity3d by default.
If you also specify a target platform, for example web player, the bundle will be named webplayer_assetbundle01.unity3d by default

You can find the editor extension in Assets->Bundle Creator->Asset Bundle Creator.
You can change all the settings necessary in the editor extension and create your bundles.

The bundle is packaged with a method on how you can load your bundles after creating them. 
To try this, open the editor extension, build the assetbundles and start the scene "LoadAssetBundleScene.unity"
